# Java-GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

After conducting an initial interview, we came to a conclusion regarding tools for remote pair and mob programming and our team decided to adopt Microsoft Teams as our F-2-F collaboration tool. There are many reasons for utilizing Teams and at first, we know that mob programming is a software development approach which refers to implementing code at the same time together as a team. We explored various tools available for mob programming, including Zoom and Teams. 
Based on our findings, we decided to use 'Teams', owing to the advantageous features that this tool offers. Below are some of the reasons which support our decision:
- Microsoft Teams has excellent built-in features including- screen sharing, recording, quick-communication chatbox and control sharing, to support our team's  coordination activities.
- All the team members are accustomed to the tool, which facilitates ease of work on the assignment.
- The tool helps make the team communication meaningful by keeping team members informed.

Based on the given instructions, we cloned the Gilded Rose refactoring kata git repository and choose 'JAVA' code for further testing, refactoring the legacy code, removing code smells, and to add the new 'Conjured' item. Our team focused on achieving excellent code coverage of the production code and conducted unit testing using IntelliJ IDEA. We then removed the code smells to the maximum point and refactored the code by ensuring that, the code is short and concise. Further, at every step done, we tested and confirmed that, the existing code functionality is not distrubed. We then added new features based on the team discussion by following Test Driven Development (TDD). Our test finding indicates that every test has passed and the Conjured items we added degrade twice as fast as ordinary items. We recorded each session and took screenshots as instructed by the professor. Each file/item were uploaded to SharePoint and the links have been added in this README file.
