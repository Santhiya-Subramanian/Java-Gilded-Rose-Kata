# Java-Gilded-Rose-Kata

After conducting an initial interview, we came to a conclusion regarding tools for remote pair and mob programming and our team decided to adopt Microsoft Teams as our F-2-F collaboration tool. There are many reasons for utilizing Teams and at first, we know that mob programming refers to implementing codes at the same time together in a team. We study various tools available for mob programming including Zoom and Teams. Based on our findings on specific features, we decided to use Teams as a tool. A couple of reason was behind to use of Teams and are as follows:
- Microsoft Teams has excellent built-in features including: screen sharing, recording, quick communication chatbox, control sharing, to support team coordination activities.
- All the team members are accustomed to the tool and hence, it becomes easier to work on the assignment using this tool.
- The tool helps to make team communication meaningful by keeping team members informed.

Based on the given instruction, we cloned Gilded Rose refactoring kata git repository and choose JAVA as a language for further testing, refactoring the legacy code, removing code smells, and adding new features. Our team focuses on achieving excellent code coverage of the production code and conducted unit testing using IntelliJ IDEA. We then removed code smells at maximum point and refactored the code where we ensured the code is short and concise accordingly. We then added new features based on team discussion by following Test Driven Development (TDD). Our test finding indicates that every test has passed and the Conjured items we added degrade twice as fast as ordinary items. We recorded each session and take screenshots as the professor instructed. Each file/item were uploaded on SharePoint and links are added in this README file.
